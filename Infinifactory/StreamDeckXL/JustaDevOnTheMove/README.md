## Preparing the profile for first use

Once you have the two require plugins installed you will be able to install and use this profile. Since the various blocks don't have keybindings, I've had to simulate pressing and holding down the `Block Menu` key (default is: Shift), then moving the mouse cursor to the spacific location on the screen, then clicking the with the left mouse button, then finally, releasing the `Block Menu` key.

As such, you may find that at your specific screen resolution, you may need to adjust the coordinates for each button.
