## About

### Design philosophy

These screens have been designed and organised slightly different from the in-game menu to try to make functionality available in less steps.

The goal was to also remove the need to use the keyboard leaving you with one hand on the mouse and the other on the Stream Deck.

### The meaning of colours

<img src="../../images/background/bg-sky.png" alt="Sky blue" height="20" /> Buttons on a sky blue background are persistent navigation buttons (example: up, down, left, right, rotate, flip, etc...)

<img src="../../images/background/bg-black.png" alt="Sky blue" height="20" /> Buttons on a black background are menu (folder) buttons buttons that reveal additional buttons when pressed. These are generally used when there are too many items to fit on the existing screen.

<img src="../../images/icons/nav-back-orange.png" alt="Sky blue" height="20" /> These orange buttons are to exit the current sub folder menu.

<img src="../../images/background/bg-slate.png" alt="Sky blue" height="20" /> Buttons on a slate gray background are tool item buttons (example: belt, pipe, wire, etc...)
